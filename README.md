# CodeAlpha_To-Do-List

"My Todo List it’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do."

One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organized. When you
write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you’ve got a clear outline of the tasks you’ve
got to do and those you’ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other
more creative tasks.
When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and achievement,
something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next. If you feel a sense of achievement, it
spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward.
But that’s not the only benefit of a to do list. Here are a few more:

1. Improves Your Memory
2.Increases Productivity
3.Helps with Motivation

Todo list offer a way to increase productivity, stopping you from forgetting things, helps prioritize tasks,
manage tasks effectively, use time wisely and improve time management as well as workflow.
